Adds handles around images so you can resize them live in Chrome, Safari and other webkit browsers!

== Description ==

Ever wonder why you can't resize images in the wordpress editior like you can in Firefox and Internet Explorer? Well now you can.  Just upload and activate this plugin and you should be set.  

Just to be clear, I did not create this function.  I found it here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/solution-you-can-resize-images-in-chromesafariwebkit and placed it into a plugin for others to use.
I also removed the donate link as appearantly it was not in good taste.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `image-resize.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can now resize images in the wordpress tinyMCE editor.

== Screenshots ==

1. Action shot.
